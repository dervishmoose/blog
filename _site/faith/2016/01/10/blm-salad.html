When the organization I work for came out in support of parts of Black Lives Matter, my first thought was, “Wait you can do that? You can salad bar Black Lives Matter?” Can you take the parts you like and leave the things you don’t like in a movement? If you are a Christian, you already do that.</p>

<p>Black Lives Matter always seemed a long way away from me. I never took time to think about would I support BLM. As I started to put together the few things that I thought I knew about BLM, I realized that I did not know much about it.</p>

<p>Is BLM the manifestation of, “Hey where is my jetpack?” from the 1960s civil rights movement? The 1960s civil rights movement left off with hope that someday the dream of Martin Luther King Jr. would be actualized. TV shows like Star Trek showed a utopian future where the dream came true. Is the Black Lives Matter movement of 2015 the group realization that the dream has not yet coming true and something needed to be done?</p>

<p>Is the BLM movement, a pushback against the police system? On the surface the BLM protests seem to follow events of deaths of black civilians by police. There also seems to be a militant faction of the movement advising aggression and violence towards police officers.</p>

<p>BLM seems to encompass all of the above and much more. To quote Greg Jao “Movements are messy”. My experience in movements seems to be, each person in the movement has their own idea what they movement is about. There is no authoritative structure in a movement to say here is the doctorial cannon that we follow. Very messy in deed.</p>

<p>You don’t have to look far to see a parallel between the messiness of BLM and the Christian Church or dare I say Christian Movement. We are masters of Salad Baring. Just look at the “taking and leaving” we do: Catholic vs Protestant, Calvin vs Arminian, Baptist Vs Presbyterian or even PCA Presbyterian Vs PCUSA Presbyterian. All of these things are labels for groups of beliefs or doctrines.</p>

<p>Can you as a person or an organization support parts of a moments? Yes, you can. So I can now say that I support and align with parts of the Black Lives Matter Movement. Let’s start with the simple statement of anyone made in the likeness of God deserves safety, dignity and respect. Then as time goes on, let’s see what finer detail and specific items I can align with.</p>
