It's chili time again! With minor tweaks I won the crowd favorite in our office chili cook-off with this recipe.

http://allrecipes.com/recipe/bushs-white-chicken-chili/

My Tweaks:

- Gluten free flour
- More Beans
- Season the chicken when cooking with red chili powder and smoked chipotle powder.
- Add lots of smoked chipotle powder

Finding a good smoked Chipotle Powder is the hard part. I could not find a dark and smoky chipotle powder, so I made my own. The chipotle powder turned out almost black and is the source of the dark smoky yumminess of the Chicken Chili.

I have tried McCormick's Chipotle Powder is rather hot and not that smoky.
