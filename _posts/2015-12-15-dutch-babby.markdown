Makes 2 large pancakes, 4-6 servings each (maybe 2 servings each... for big men)

4 eggs
1 cup milk
1 cup flour
1 teaspoon sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter

Lemon wedges
Powdered sugar
Berries
Pure maple syrup

Preheat oven to 425° F.

Whisk eggs, milk, flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl, or whiz in a blender. Let stand for 30 minutes at room temperature.

Divide butter between two 9 or 10-inch cast iron skillets, glass baking dishes, or one larger rectangular roasting pan. Place in oven until butter melts. Remove pans, swirling butter to coat sides. Divide batter between pans. Bake on lowest rack until golden brown, set on center rack and allow to bake until sides rise high above the sides of the pans, 12-15 minutes.

Slice pancake into wedges and serve with dusting of sugar, berries and a squirt of lemon juice, or just some good maple syrup.



(I don't see much of any difference in the result of moving the skillets from the middle racks to the higher ones. I have done it both ways. It seems that you can just plan for 20-25 mins @ 425° F )
