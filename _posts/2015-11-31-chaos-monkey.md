Ok you had me at Rambo Architecture.... but Rambo Architecture vs Chaos Monkey gotta read....

Here is a fantastic article about Netflix using Amazon Web Services and maintaining uptime even if the cloud hosting is having issues. This article introduces "Rambo Architecture"- "Each system has to be able to succeed, no matter what, even all on its own.‚Äù And it also introduces "The Chaos Monkey" test scrips, that randomly turns off servers and data bases to make sure the Rambo Architecture keeps running. Stop I my inner server admin is 1/2 crying and 1/2 laughing.
